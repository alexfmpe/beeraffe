# BEERAFFE

This is the source for the webgame BEERAFFE at <https://jaspervdj.be/beeraffe/>.

I did this as a silly weekend(s) project, so don't expect high quality code
(it's also my first PureScript project, although I come from a Haskell
perspective).  Especially the build system is a bit of a mess.

Contributions welcome.
